DROPPED FEATURES:
- AutoUnattend.xml | Broken

- PreActivated Windows/Office (IDK, just too lazy to fix)

What to Expect?
1. Fast installation:
   - Less than 20 Minutes install time | Windows install + OOBE SETUP
   - Less than an hour to install drivers and set up activation

2. Stable environment for long-term use:
   - Valid system integrity
   - Windows Update support (not broken like in other modifications)

3. Faster environtment than Consumer Build
   - enjoy LTSC taste like Consumer build :D

NOTES:
- A CMD Popup may appear after installation, cause im using Registry tweak RunOnce to enable End task and Explorer Tweaks
- dont worry it just for first time installation.


this script refer to:
- Tiny11 builder GitHub | https://github.com/ntdevlabs/tiny11builder
- https://github.com/chrisGrando/tiny11builder-24H2

key differences:
- My script only edit the wim file, not including create ISO features
- Later maybe i will add feature to build ISO like TinyBuilder.
